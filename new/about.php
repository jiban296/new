            <h2>What is Futsal?</h2>
            <div class="futsal-info-content">
                <div class="futsal-info-text">
                    <p>Futsal is a dynamic and fast-paced variant of soccer, played on a smaller, hard court with a smaller ball that has less bounce than a regular soccer ball. The game is typically played indoors, with teams of five players, including the goalkeeper. Futsal emphasizes ball control, quick decision-making, and tactical play.</p>
                    <p>This sport is a fantastic way to improve your soccer skills, as the smaller playing area and fewer players mean more touches on the ball and more opportunities to develop agility, precision, and teamwork.</p>
